The final goal is to complete implementation of a lazy-loaded list of images.
There must be a vertical list that loads (using lazy loading), stores and displays square images.

## Requirements

1. Using styled-components, make sure that list and all the cards look correctly, images are centered and scaled to fit the whole area of the card
2. Axios must be configured to fetch images. Offset and result number must be configurable
3. Setup Redux Toolkit and use it to store the images.
4. Usage of react hooks is required
5. Typescript is a must for all files (including existing ones)
6. Feel free to create new components/containers if it's necessary
## API
